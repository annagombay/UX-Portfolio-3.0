                  ESR's website lacked user-centricity 
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Over the course of several years, ESR and their user base had evolved but their promotional website hadn't. 
                </p>
                <p> 
                  The existing design did not capitalize on ESR's most valuable offerings and risked being out of sync with their contemporary users' interests.

                <p>
                  With a limited research budget, I needed a creative way to learn about the current users' needs and pain points. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  As such, I scoured through hundreds of recent user emails and synthesized their discourse into broad themes. I validated my research through consultations with the company's CEO and my senior colleagues. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Safety, community, and competition were the most salient themes I extracted, and they became the foundation of my design approach as I aimed to enhance the user-centricity of the website.

              <p>
                CRASHLIGHT is a safety feature developed by ESR that automatically detects motorcycle crashes and notifies up to three contacts with the rider's exact location via SMS (text) message, automated phone call, and email.
              </p>
              <p>
                I devoted a full web-page using a high contrast background colour to bring attention to this feature. I also incorporated two hyperlinks and included a design element advertising CRASHLIGHT's 30-day free trial to encourage users to learn more about the offering.
